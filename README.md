### Jupyter notebook would not render on Git.  After research it appears it is due to RAM.  I have also included the link to my Collab Notebook for review. Please see link below to my Collab Notebook to view.

## Summary

#### After review of the MercadoLibre data we were able to assess patterns in Google Search Traffic.  After review it appears that searches increase towards the late 4th Quarter and early 1st Quarter of the year.  This would coincide with shopping during the holiday months.  It is interesting to note on the heatmap that search trends peak on Tuesday through Wednesday with peak hours starting late into the evening and earlier in the morning hours.

#### After review search trends against the stock changes you can see a correlation between search trends and stock changes.  The changes appear not to happen necessarily due to volume of searches, but the relationship between the increase and decrease in the stock does show some correlation to search trends.  

#### It appears that Mercado Libre continues to increase in popularity towards the end of 2020, which is a positive outlook for 2021.
